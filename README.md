# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-and-Prediction-on-Diabetes-Data

About this Repository

This repository serves as a hub for conducting exploratory data analysis and predictive modeling on the diabetes dataset. It aims to provide insights into the data's features and their impact on the diagnosis of diabetes. Various machine learning techniques may be employed to build predictive models. 

Overview

This dataset is sourced from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. Its primary objective is to predict diagnostically whether a patient has diabetes or not, based on specific diagnostic measurements contained within the dataset. The selection of these instances was subject to certain constraints, with all patients in this dataset being females, at least 21 years old, and of Pima Indian heritage.

Content

The dataset comprises a set of medical predictor variables and one target variable called "Outcome." The predictor variables include details such as the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their Body Mass Index (BMI), insulin levels, age, and more. These variables play a crucial role in predicting the likelihood of diabetes in the patient.
